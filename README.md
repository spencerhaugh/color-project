# The Color Project

## Overview

This was an amazing project! There was so much in here to learn, from drag-and-drop to UI libraries to some deep learning with managing state in React applications.  
I had a lot of fun work through all the various elements of this app, and it has undoubtedly made me a stronger developer.  
Looking forward to the next one!
