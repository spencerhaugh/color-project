# The Color Project

## Overview

Deployed Site: [Palette Builder App](https://cranky-murdock-697124.netlify.app/)

This was an amazing project! There was so much in here to learn, from drag-and-drop to several really useful UI libraries to some deep learning with managing state in React applications.  
The project was created a few years ago by Colt Steele, and I had to learn how to adapt several elements of the project into more modern code, for example I adapted many pages into functional React components, and also adapt the code to work around various updates to libraries like Material UI.

I had a lot of fun working through all the various elements of this app, and it has undoubtedly made me a much stronger developer.  
Looking forward to the next one!
